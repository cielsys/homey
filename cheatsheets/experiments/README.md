# Cheat Sheet experiments
These files are left over from my dev forays into xml/xslt/css for the emacs cheatsheet.
None of the files in this folder are required (I think)
I wish I had made more comments! I've left them in the repo because the old stuff may help me
understand how this works when I decide to clean this up and generalize the mechanism for
the other cheatsheets I have planned.

## Acknowledgements
The original cheatsheet that I liked because it had multi columns
for move-fwd move-bwd del-fwd del-bwd came from here<br/>
[Bob's Emacs Cheatsheet](http://www.rgrjr.com/emacs/emacs_cheat.html)
Thanks Bob and David for the template.<br/>
A [local copy](./bobs_emacs_cheat_sheet.html) of that html file resides here and in the repo because I used it for my initial foray into 
XSLT processing and may wish to refer to it again.
